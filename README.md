# Example project

This is an example project of how to link Stata and R code to Latex/Overleaf using GitHub. 

The Stata code also shows how to link Stata output and latex. 

This is built upon a large number of aggregated forum responses and coauthor input. If anything is broken or unclear, it is almost certainly an error I introduced. Let me know if you have any additional tips that would be useful to add.
