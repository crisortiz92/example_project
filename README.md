# Example project

This is an example project of how to link Stata and R code to Latex/Overleaf using GitHub. 

The Stata code also shows how to link Stata output and latex. 

This is built upon a large number of aggregated forum responses and coauthor input. If anything is broken or unclear, it is almost certainly an error I introduced. Let me know if you have any additional tips that would be useful to add. 

A video walkthrough of this project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRakB2fxWYc&feature=youtu.be as was featured on the podcast, The Hidden Curriculum.
